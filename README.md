# AKARI #
My personal Spotify Assistant to be able to play without opening Spotify 
It uses Spotify API to avoid calling the Spotify App to the front and disrupting your game 


# Installation#
install requirements.txt with the next command ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

install Spotify APP ```(https://www.spotify.com/us/download)```
