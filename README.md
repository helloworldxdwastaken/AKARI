# AKARI #
My personal Spotify Assistant to be able to play without opening Spotify 
It uses Spotify API to avoid calling the Spotify App to the front and disrupting your game 


# Installation#
1- install requirements.txt with the next command ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
2- install Spotify APP https://www.spotify.com/us/download
3- Open Spotify on the device u want to control (ex: PC, Mobile)
  - Bot will list the devices that are open and will play there
3- Set Up Spotify API Credentials
 - Create a Spotify Developer Account:
 - [Go to Spotify Developer Dashboard.](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
 - Log in with your Spotify account and create a new application.
 - Get Your Client ID and Client Secret and paste it the bot 
Enjoy!
